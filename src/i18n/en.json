    "description": "A modular blockchain differs from a monolithic chain in that one or more of these four functions are offloaded to a separate layer. Sunrise is an example of a blockchain that specializes in fulfilling the function of data availability (“DA”) and consensus by offloading the responsibility of transaction execution and settlement to a different network."
