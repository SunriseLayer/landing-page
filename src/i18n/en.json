    "description": "A monolithic chain is a generalist blockchain that performs all tasks. Overall, the monolithic approach is to “do everything yourself”. However, this approach is expensive, not customizable, and not scalable. It's extremely slow to build and deploy modern applications directly on monolithic chains. It's an outdated formula, ready for disruption."

    "label": "The modular paradigm is already here.",
    "description": "A modular blockchain differs from a monolithic chain in that its four main functions can each be offloaded to a separate layer. Sunrise is an example of a blockchain that specializes in fulfilling the function of data availability (“DA”) and consensus, while offloading the responsibility of execution and settlement to a different network. By using this structure, Modular Blockchains are more efficient, customizable, scalable, sovereign..."

    "description": "Sunrise provides a fast and secure data and consensus layer that gives you all you need to launch a sustainable modular blockchain. With Sunrise, your chain can become scalable and sovereign, giving you the freedom to build your chain anyway you want. Sunrise's DA layer supports any execution environment, empowering you to create next-gen blockchain solutions."

    "label": "The unique value of Sunrise",
    "description": "Sunrise brings further innovation to the modular paradigm by introducing unique functionality for AltDA: Any Token for Fees, and Sovereign Proof of Liquidity. Sunrise resolves singular token dependency by allowing users of its DA layer to pay for gas fees with “any token”. Tokens received by Sunrise are locked in long term, preventing selling pressure against fees received and earning yield for Sunrise stakers. Sunrise also resolves the liquidity issue faced by sovereign rollups by enabling “Proof of Liquidity”, which incentivizes governance participants and liquidity providers. Pairing the Sunrise token with the sovereign rollup’s native token creates a mutual feedback loop that simultaneously enhances liquidity and security for both the Sunrise DA layer and any rollup deployed onto it. Together, these unique functions supercharge Data Availability while enhancing liquidity and sovereignty for developers."
